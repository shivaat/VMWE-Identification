The system SHOMA participated in Parseme 2018 shared task on [`automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions - edition 1.1`](http://multiword.sourceforge.net/PHITE.php?sitesig=CONF&page=CONF_04_LAW-MWE-CxG_2018___lb__COLING__rb__&subpage=CONF_40_Shared_Task).

We developed a ConvNet + LSTM (+ CRF) neural network architecture which recieves pre-trained embedding for words and one-hot representation for POS tags as inputs.

The data is annotated by Parseme members and more information about it is available at a [Parseme dedicated page](http://parsemefr.lif.univ-mrs.fr/parseme-st-guidelines/1.1/). We converted the data to our favourable format of .pkl lists which ignore dependency parsed information which we do not use for this system. The labels in our .pkl lists are in IOB-like format.
